"""Debug helper removed.

This file previously contained an ad-hoc script used for manual DB inspection
during development. It has been neutralized to avoid accidental execution.

If you want a replacement diagnostic, I can add a safe, read-only admin route
to the Flask app or recreate a small script that only reads and prints rows.
